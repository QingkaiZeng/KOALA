# ConceptNet Retrieval

1. The original ConceptNet is multi-lingual, so we only keep the English triples. This means both the subject and the object contain only English letters.
2. Prune the graph: only keep those relations in `relation_direction.txt`, remove stop words in the original triple, and adjust the weight of triples (`relatedto` and `antonym` triples receives an additional -0.3, `atlocation` triples receives an additional +0.5)
3. Rough retrieval: retrieve those triples whose subject or object matches with the given entity. For some relations, the entity must be the subject but for others, either subject or object is ok (see `relation_direction.txt` for detail). Stemming is used to perform soft matching. We remove stop words before matching. If the entity is a single word, then we directly use string matching. If the entity is a multi-word phrase, we keep those entity-concept pairs with Jaccard similarity >= 0.5. The concept should be a noun (if POS is specified).
4. Precise retrieval: we use the paragraph to perform precise retrieval. After removing stop words, we use the paragraph to match the triples extracted from the last step. If the neighbor concept (to the entity) is contained in the paragraph (Jaccard similarity >= 0.5), then we keep this triple. The retrieved triples are sorted by weight and top 10 are selected. If the triples are less than 10, then we use the top-weighted triples in the candidates to fill the remaining places.
